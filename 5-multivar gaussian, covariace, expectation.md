## You asked:

what are marginals in a covariance matrix in a multivariate gaussian distribution with say x1 and x2 and what do they mean?

## Gemini Replied:

In a covariance matrix for a multivariate Gaussian distribution with two variables,  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$ , the "marginals" are the diagonal elements. These are simply the **variances** of each individual variable.

For a 2D case, the covariance matrix, denoted as  $\Sigma$ , looks like this:

$$
\Sigma =\left(Var\left(x_{1}\right)Cov\left(x_{2},x_{1}\right)‚ÄãCov\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)Var\left(x_{2}\right)‚Äã\right)=\left(\sigma _{12}\rho \sigma _{1}\sigma _{2}‚Äã\rho \sigma _{1}\sigma _{2}\sigma _{22}‚Äã\right)
$$

The marginals are the terms on the main diagonal:

*    $Var\left(x_{1}\right)$  or  $\sigma _{12}$ : This is the variance of the variable  $x_{1}$ .
    
*    $Var\left(x_{2}\right)$  or  $\sigma _{22}$ : This is the variance of the variable  $x_{2}$ .
    

* * *

What They Mean
--------------

The marginal variances tell you about the **spread or uncertainty of each variable individually**, ignoring its relationship with the other variables. üßê

Imagine you have a dataset of people's heights ( $x_{1}$ ) and weights ( $x_{2}$ ).

*   **Marginal Variance of Height ( $\sigma _{12}$ )**: This value describes how much the heights vary on their own. A large variance means there's a wide range of heights in your dataset (from very short to very tall). A small variance means most people are very close to the average height. It tells you this _without_ considering what their weight is.
    
*   **Marginal Variance of Weight ( $\sigma _{22}$ )**: Similarly, this value describes the spread of the weights, independent of height.
    

Essentially, if you were to "project" all the data points onto the  $x_{1}$ \-axis, the variance of those projected points would be  $\sigma _{12}$ . Likewise for  $x_{2}$ . These individual, or marginal, distributions are themselves Gaussian. So, the marginal distribution for  $x_{1}$  is a normal distribution with its own mean  $\mu _{1}$  and variance  $\sigma _{12}$ , written as  $N\left(\mu _{1},\sigma _{12}\right)$ .

In the plot above, the joint distribution of  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  is shown as a 2D ellipse.

*   The **width of the bell curve** along the  $x_{1}$  axis represents the marginal distribution of  $x_{1}$ , and its spread is determined by  $\sigma _{12}$ .
    
*   The **width of the bell curve** along the  $x_{2}$  axis represents the marginal distribution of  $x_{2}$ , and its spread is determined by  $\sigma _{22}$ .
    

In contrast, the **off-diagonal** elements,  $Cov\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)$ , tell you how the variables move **together**. A positive covariance means that when  $x_{1}$  is high,  $x_{2}$  tends to be high as well (like height and weight). The marginals, however, just focus on one variable at a time.

## You asked:

what does integrating out x1 and leaving x2 mean in the multivariate gaussian distribution?

---

## Gemini Replied:

In a multivariate Gaussian distribution, "integrating out  $x_{1}$ " means you are mathematically removing the variable  $x_{1}$  from the joint probability distribution to find the probability distribution of only  $x_{2}$ .

This process, also called **marginalization**, answers the question: "What is the probability distribution of  $x_{2}$ , regardless of the value of  $x_{1}$ ?"

* * *

What It Means Conceptually
--------------------------

Imagine a 3D plot of a two-variable Gaussian distribution, which looks like a hill rising from a 2D plane. The two horizontal axes are  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$ , and the vertical axis is the probability density.

"Integrating out  $x_{1}$ " is like squashing this entire 3D hill flat against the wall formed by the  $p\left(x\right)$  and  $x_{2}$  axes. You are essentially summing up all the probability slices along the  $x_{1}$  direction for every possible value of  $x_{2}$ .

The result is the "shadow" that the hill casts on that  $x_{2}$ \-wall. This shadow is the **marginal distribution** of  $x_{2}$ . A key property of the multivariate Gaussian is that this shadow, or marginal distribution, will itself be a perfect, one-dimensional Gaussian (a simple bell curve).

* * *

The Mathematical View
---------------------

If you have a joint probability density function for two variables,  $p\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)$ , integrating out  $x_{1}$  is done by computing the following integral:

$$
p\left(x_{2}\right)=\int_{‚àí‚àû}^{‚àû} p\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)dx_{1}
$$

*   ** $p\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)$ **: The joint probability of both  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  occurring together.
    
*   ** $\int_{‚àí‚àû}^{‚àû} ...dx_{1}$ **: This part sums up the probabilities over _all possible values_ of  $x_{1}$ .
    
*   ** $p\left(x_{2}\right)$ **: The result is the marginal probability of  $x_{2}$ , which tells you the probability of  $x_{2}$  occurring on its own.
    

### The Bottom Line

For a multivariate Gaussian distribution, this process is incredibly simple. If your original joint distribution has a mean vector  $\mu =\left(\mu _{1}\mu _{2}‚Äã\right)$  and a covariance matrix  $\Sigma =\left(\sigma _{12}Cov\left(x_{2},x_{1}\right)‚ÄãCov\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)\sigma _{22}‚Äã\right)$ , the resulting marginal distribution for  $x_{2}$  is simply a univariate Gaussian:

$$
p\left(x_{2}\right)=N\left(\mu _{2},\sigma _{22}\right)
$$

You just **pick out the mean and variance corresponding to  $x_{2}$ ** from the original mean vector and covariance matrix. Integrating out  $x_{1}$  effectively discards all information about  $x_{1}$  and its relationship with  $x_{2}$ , leaving you with the standalone distribution of  $x_{2}$ .

## You asked:

what if there were three variables x1,x2 and x3, how would the covariance matrix for the multivariate gaussian look like

---

## Gemini Replied:

For three variables ( $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}$ ), the covariance matrix ( $\Sigma$ ) for a multivariate Gaussian distribution is a **3x3 symmetric matrix**.

It shows the variance of each variable along its main diagonal and the covariance between each pair of variables in the off-diagonal positions.

* * *

### The Structure

The covariance matrix  $\Sigma$  looks like this:

$$
\Sigma =\left‚ÄãVar\left(x_{1}\right)Cov\left(x_{2},x_{1}\right)Cov\left(x_{3},x_{1}\right)‚ÄãCov\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)Var\left(x_{2}\right)Cov\left(x_{3},x_{2}\right)‚ÄãCov\left(x_{1},x_{3}\right)Cov\left(x_{2},x_{3}\right)Var\left(x_{3}\right)‚Äã\right‚Äã
$$

Using the more common notation where  $Var\left(x_{i}\right)=\sigma _{i2}$ :

$$
\Sigma =\left‚Äã\sigma _{12}Cov\left(x_{2},x_{1}\right)Cov\left(x_{3},x_{1}\right)‚ÄãCov\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)\sigma _{22}Cov\left(x_{3},x_{2}\right)‚ÄãCov\left(x_{1},x_{3}\right)Cov\left(x_{2},x_{3}\right)\sigma _{32}‚Äã\right‚Äã
$$

* * *

### What Each Part Means

*   **Diagonal Elements (Marginal Variances)**: The values on the main diagonal ( $\sigma _{12},\sigma _{22},\sigma _{32}$ ) are the **variances** of each variable. They tell you the spread of each variable _individually_, ignoring the others. For example,  $\sigma _{12}$  describes how much  $x_{1}$  varies on its own.
    
*   **Off-Diagonal Elements (Covariances)**: These values describe the **pairwise linear relationship** between variables.
    
    *    $Cov\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)$  tells you how  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  vary together. A positive value means they tend to increase or decrease together; a negative value means one tends to increase when the other decreases.
        
    *   A value of zero would imply they are uncorrelated.
        
*   **Symmetry**: The matrix is always **symmetric**. This is because the covariance of  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  is the same as the covariance of  $x_{2}$  and  $x_{1}$  (i.e.,  $Cov\left(x_{i},x_{j}\right)=Cov\left(x_{j},x_{i}\right)$ ). So, the element at row 1, column 2 is identical to the element at row 2, column 1.
