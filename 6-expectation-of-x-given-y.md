## You asked:

what does expectation of X given Y mean. my instructor said that this quantity is a random variable. however, expectation of X give Y=y is a function of y instead. can you explain me what expectation mean in this case? I know that expectation of a random variable is basically the average of the values of the output of g(X) where g is function taking random variable X as input, where X is a real number line to which the outcome space was mapped to

Of course! Your instructor is correct on both points, and your confusion is very common. The distinction between  $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$  and  $E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$  is one of the most important concepts in probability theory.

Let's break it down.

### The Key Distinction

The core idea is this:

*   ** $E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$ ** is a **fixed number** (or a function that gives a fixed number). You are given a specific piece of information ( $Y$  is _exactly_ equal to some value  $y$ ) and you calculate the expected value of  $X$  based on that.
    
*   ** $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$ ** is a **random variable**. You haven't been told the value of  $Y$  yet. The value of this expectation _depends on what the random outcome of Y turns out to be_.
    

* * *

Let's Use an Analogy: Heights and Ages üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
--------------------------------------------------

Imagine you have a large population.

*   Let **X** be the **height** of a randomly chosen person.
    
*   Let **Y** be the **age** of that same person.
    

### Case 1:  $E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$  (The Function)

This asks, "What is the expected height of a person, given that we know their age is _y_?"

*   If I ask for ** $E\left[X‚à£Y=10\right]$ **, I'm asking for the average height of all 10-year-olds. You can go find all the 10-year-olds, measure their heights, and compute the average. This will be a single number, say 138 cm.
    
*   If I ask for ** $E\left[X‚à£Y=30\right]$ **, I'm asking for the average height of all 30-year-olds. This will be another single number, maybe 175 cm.
    

As you can see, for any specific age _y_ you give me, I can give you back a specific average height. This defines a function, let's call it  $h\left(y\right)$ .

$$
h\left(y\right)=E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]
$$

This function  $h\left(y\right)$  takes a specific age and returns a number. **It is not random.**

### Case 2:  $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$  (The Random Variable) ü§î

This is the more abstract concept. It asks, "What is the expected height of a person, given their age?" Notice I haven't told you the age yet!

Before we randomly select a person, we don't know their age (Y is random). Therefore, we also don't know the _average height corresponding to that unknown age_.

The conditional expectation ** $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$ ** is the random variable that takes on the value  $h\left(y\right)=E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$  when the person we randomly select happens to have an age of  $Y=y$ .

*   You pick a person. If they turn out to be 10 years old, the value of  $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$  for this person is 138 cm.
    
*   You pick another person. If they are 30, the value of  $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$  is 175 cm.
    

Since the output value depends on the random outcome of Y, ** $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$  is itself a random variable.** Its randomness comes entirely from the randomness of Y.

Think of the blue line in the plot above as the function  $h\left(y\right)=E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$ .

*   ** $E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$ ** is a single point on that line for a specific _y_.
    
*   ** $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$ ** is the random variable representing the height of the line itself, before you've chosen a specific age _y_ on the x-axis.

This leads to a very famous and useful identity called the **Law of Total Expectation**:

$$
E\left[E\left[X‚à£Y\right]\right]=E\left[X\right]
$$

This means that if you take the expectation of the random variable  $E\left[X‚à£Y\right]$ , you get back the original, overall expectation of  $X$ . In our analogy: if you average all the group averages (the average height of 10-year-olds, 11-year-olds, etc., weighted by how many people are in each age group), you get the average height of the entire population. üí°

## You asked:

what about the definition of expection my instructor told me? is it a correct way to think about it? can you add more insights and also help me connect the expection of x given y as explained earlier?

  

¬†I know that expectation of a random variable is basically the average of the values of the output of g(X) where g is function taking random variable X as input, where X is a real number line to which the outcome space was mapped to

## Gemini Replied:

Yes, the way your instructor explained expectation is a perfectly correct and powerful way to think about it. It captures the essence of how expectation works for any function of a random variable.

Let's refine that definition, add some more insight, and then explicitly connect it to the conditional expectation we discussed earlier.

* * *

Refining the Definition of Expectation
--------------------------------------

Your understanding is spot on. A random variable  $X$  maps outcomes from an experiment to numbers. The expectation,  $E\left[X\right]$ , is the **weighted average** of these numbers, where the weights are their probabilities.

If we have a function  $g\left(X\right)$  (like  $X^{2}$  or  $sin\left(X\right)$ ), the expectation  $E\left[g\left(X\right)\right]$  is the weighted average of the _output values_ of  $g\left(X\right)$ .

**For a discrete random variable:** You sum up each possible output value of  $g\left(x\right)$  multiplied by the probability of that value occurring.

$$
E\left[g\left(X\right)\right]=\sum_{all x} g\left(x\right)P\left(X=x\right)
$$

**For a continuous random variable:** You integrate the output value  $g\left(x\right)$  multiplied by the probability density function  $f_{X}\left(x\right)$ . Integration is just the continuous version of summing.

$$
E\left[g\left(X\right)\right]=\int_{‚àí‚àû}^{‚àû} g\left(x\right)f_{X}\left(x\right)dx
$$

Deeper Insights: Two Key Analogies ü§î
-------------------------------------

Thinking of expectation as just an "average" is good, but two analogies make the concept much more intuitive.

### 1\. The Center of Mass

This is the most powerful physical analogy for expectation. Imagine the real number line is a long, weightless rod.

*   For a **discrete** variable, at each possible value  $x$ , place a weight equal to its probability  $P\left(X=x\right)$ . The expected value,  $E\left[X\right]$ , is the **balance point** or **center of mass** of this system of weights.
    
*   For a **continuous** variable, the probability density function  $f_{X}\left(x\right)$  describes how a total mass of 1 is "smeared" across the rod. The expected value,  $E\left[X\right]$ , is still the center of mass of this distribution.
    

_This tells you that the expectation is the central point of the distribution's "weight," not necessarily its geometric center._

### 2\. The Long-Run Average

The expectation is the value you would expect to get if you could repeat your random experiment an infinite number of times and average the results.

For example, the expected value of a single six-sided die roll is 3.5. You will never actually roll a 3.5! But if you were to roll the die thousands of times and average all the outcomes, your average would get extremely close to 3.5. This is formalized by the **Law of Large Numbers**.

* * *

Connecting Expectation to Conditional Expectation üí°
----------------------------------------------------

Now, let's use this refined understanding to connect back to  $E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$ .

The key is that **conditional expectation is just a regular expectation calculated on a new, restricted probability space.**

When we are "given  $Y=y$ ," our universe of possibilities shrinks. We are no longer looking at the entire population; we're only looking at the sub-population where the age is exactly  $y$ . This sub-population has its own probability distribution, called the **conditional probability distribution**.

*   For discrete variables, this is  $P\left(X=x‚à£Y=y\right)$ .
    
*   For continuous variables, this is the conditional density function  $f_{X‚à£Y}\left(x‚à£y\right)$ .
    

So, to calculate  $E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$ , we just apply the standard definition of expectation using this new conditional distribution:

$$
E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]=\int_{‚àí‚àû}^{‚àû} x\cdot f_{X‚à£Y}\left(x‚à£y\right)dx
$$

In terms of our analogy:  $E\left[X‚à£Y=10\right]$  is the **center of mass** of the height distribution for _only_ the 10-year-olds. We ignore everyone else. We calculate the balance point for just that slice of the data.

So, your instructor's definition holds perfectly.  $E\left[X‚à£Y=y\right]$  is the average of the values of  $X$ , but the "weights" (the probabilities) used in that average are the _conditional_ probabilities, which are valid only within the specific group where  $Y=y$ .
